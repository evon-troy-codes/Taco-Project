# Taco-Project
My Challenge: I will utilize the knowledge I have gained from the HTML for Beginners tutorial series to build a website for The Little Taco Shop.

Directions:

I have images of the 3 web pages I need to build in the examples folder. I will use them as references for what I build.

I will name my files: index.html, hours.html, and contact.html.

There is minimal CSS already available in css/styles.css. I need to link that file to my HTML files.

All the images are provided in the img folder.

If I need to find taco emojis, I can try Emojipedia.

A favicon is already included. I'll need to add it in the head section of each page.
